/**
 * **What a chat's sandbox blocked, on its tab** (#1338): the operation and the kind of path or
 * host, in the core's words, and nothing of what the chat ran.
 *
 * A block of **purlis's own** operation is a purlis bug, and says so. It offers **Report…**,
 * which shows the draft the core makes from the block alone — the operation, the kind and the
 * versions — and files it only on **File report**: by the app, under the operator's own `gh`
 * login, never from inside the chat. Nothing is sent before that press. A block of the chat's own
 * work is said and can be put away; what to allow is the Sandbox settings' business.
