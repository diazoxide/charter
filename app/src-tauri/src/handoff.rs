//! The app's half of `charter handoff`: opening, in a window the operator is looking at, the
//! chat a chat of its own handed work to (charter-app#204).
//!
//! `charter handoff` does every check in front of the open. The operator's consent is the
//! harness's permission prompt in front of that exact command, and nothing here asks again:
//! the operator already answered with the brief on screen. The command then asks the app over
//! the hook socket, in two lines on one connection: a ticket, and the open that spends it.
//! `purlis_core::hookwire::OpenChat` argues what that ticket is worth and what it is not,
//! and it is not repeated here.
//!
//! What this module adds is **the questions only the app can answer**, and the one control
//! that module's argument rests on, which is visibility:
//!
//! - **The asking chat is one this app has open**, and the new chat starts on **its persona's
//!   own profile** where that persona's definition names one, else on the asking chat's, read
//!   from the app's own record of that chat (#1445). Either way it is a profile the project
//!   already offers on this machine and has approved
//!   (`purlis_core::personaprofile::for_dispatch`): a persona's file is one a chat can write,
//!   so a name it gives is only looked up, never run. One this machine does not offer falls
//!   back to the asking chat's profile, and the answer and the new chat's stamp say so
//!   (D-1445-8). The harness follows the profile, so a Claude Code chat can hand work to a
//!   persona that runs on Codex, and the first message reaches it by that harness's own route.
//! - **The first message carries the stamp** of a handoff from that chat
//!   (`purlis_core::handoff::is_stamped_from`), so the chat the operator finds on the strip
//!   always says where it came from.
//! - **It lands on a strip, and it does not take the operator's screen.** The window is told
//!   ([`ARRIVED`]) and draws a tab in the target workspace's strip without bringing it to the
//!   front and without raising the window. See [`Arrived`] for why.
//! - **It is named for its task** (charter-app#258): the `--name` the handoff carried, or the
//!   ordinary `<persona> <N>`. And it says where it came from by the parent's NAME — in its
//!   first message, and in the note its tab and header draw — never by the parent's number.
//!
//! And it answers the one ask a handed-off chat makes back: **a report** (charter-app#259).
//! The chat it goes to is the parent the app recorded when it opened the chat, never one the
//! reporting chat names, and only for a handoff that asked for one. See [`report_it`].
