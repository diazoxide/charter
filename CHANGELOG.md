# Changelog

What each release of charter, the desktop app, brought. About Charter shows the section for the
version you are running, and the same section is that version's GitHub release notes.

The app has its own version line, starting at 0.1.0. It is not the version of the Python
`charter` it was rebuilt from, whose news the `charter news` command still reads.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-25

0.2.0 is about settings that belong to a project or a workspace rather than to the machine, and
about vaults you can work with in the window. Project settings and Workspace settings are tabs of
their own, over `charter.toml`, a workspace's `workspace.json` and `charter.local.toml`, and they
choose the extensions, the theme, a workspace's colour and each harness's plugins. A vault can
live in the system keyring and opens in a tab of its own, which reveals or copies a value without
it reaching a chat, and a 1Password token moves into the keyring and out of every chat's
environment. Text size has a Preferences tab, the needs-you queue moves into the title bar, a
handoff is named for its task and can report back, and a relaunch or an update asks before it
reopens your sessions. Repos have right-click menus. The window can invoke only the commands an
allow-list grants it, and a `charter.local.toml` that git would carry no longer decides anything,
and every settings group that it would have changed says so.

### Added

- **Project settings**, a tab of its own: right-click a project's tab and choose _Project
  settings…_, or find it in the palette. It has two sections — **Shared**, `charter.toml`,
  which is committed and your team sees, and **Local**, `charter.local.toml`, which stays on
  this machine — each as a form over the keys charter documents and as raw TOML for everything
  else. Saving keeps your comments and the order of your keys, and refuses what charter would
  refuse when it next reads the file, in the same words: a forge it cannot resolve, a profile
  in the committed file, a value that looks like a credential. Local is created on the first
  save, and never where git would commit it. ([#252](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/252))
- **Extensions per project.** Each project can turn an installed extension on or off, and set
  what it declares, in either section of Project settings: Shared for the team, Local for you,
  and Local wins key by key. The tab shows every extension with what it is in this project —
  on, off, _needs approval here_, or _not installed here_ — and which file decided it. Approval
  stays with this machine: a project that enables an extension you have not approved leaves it
  off until you approve it in Extensions. A project that says nothing keeps every approved
  extension on, as before. Panels, views and themes follow the project in front, and a view
  refuses to run in a project that turned its extension off. ([#253](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/253))
- **Harness plugins per project.** Project settings has a *Harness plugins* group for each
  harness charter knows, in Shared and in Local. For Claude Code it lists the plugins installed
  on this machine, and each one can be on, off or not set for the chats charter starts in the
  project. Local wins plugin by plugin, and not set leaves the plugin to Claude Code's own
  settings. charter's own plugin is always on and the old `charter@charter` always off. No file
  can change either, and a save that tries is refused. Codex and opencode list what they have
  installed and say their plugins are not supported yet, with the reason: Codex ignores a
  plugin's on/off given for one session, and charter does not start opencode chats yet.
  ([#274](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/274))
- **A theme per project.** Project settings has a Theme select in Shared and in Local: charter's
  dark or light theme, *Follow the system*, or any theme an extension you approved contributes.
  Local wins over Shared. While that project is in front the window and every terminal draw its
  theme, and switching projects switches it live. A pick whose extension is off in the project,
  or not approved on this machine, draws the built-in dark theme, and the tab says why. A
  project's pick wins over your `theme.json`; a project that picks nothing keeps it. ([#273](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/273))
- **Workspace settings**, a tab of its own for each workspace: right-click a workspace's tab and
  choose _Workspace settings…_, or find it in the palette. A workspace can turn an extension on
  or off and set what it declares, for everyone who works in it: it is kept in the workspace's
  `workspace.json`, committed with a LIVE workspace. It sits between the project's two files —
  `charter.toml`, then the workspace, then `charter.local.toml` — so a workspace refines its
  project and this machine still has the last word, and none of them reaches past this
  machine's approval. Each extension says which of them decided it. The panels and views
  follow the workspace in front, and a view a workspace turned off says so and where. Saving
  changes nothing else in the manifest, and a `workspace.json` from before reads as it always
  did. ([#280](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/280))
- **A workspace's theme and colour.** Workspace settings has a Theme group: a theme for this
  workspace, over the project's `charter.toml` pick and under your `charter.local.toml` — each
  says which file the theme drawn there came from — and a **colour**: red, orange, yellow,
  green, teal, blue, purple, pink, or one of your own. The colour tints the same theme rather
  than replacing it: the accent and the focus ring while the workspace is in front, its tab and
  its chat strip, and a dot on its tab and in the title bar. Text and the terminal keep the
  theme's colours, so everything stays as readable as the theme was. Every workspace tab shows
  its own colour whether or not it is in front, and switching workspaces switches the theme and
  the tint live — the window's theme now follows the workspace in front, not only the project.
  ([#281](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/281))
- A workspace can also turn each harness's plugins on or off, in **Workspace settings**: one
  **Harness plugins** group per harness, as in Project settings, with each plugin saying whether
  `charter.toml`, the workspace's `workspace.json` or `charter.local.toml` decided it, or that
  nothing did. A Claude Code chat started in the workspace gets that set; Codex and opencode say
  their plugins are not supported yet, for a workspace as for a project. charter's own plugin
  stays on and the old one stays off whatever a workspace says.
  ([#282](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/282))
- `charter.toml` and `charter.local.toml` accept a `[plane]` section and a `[repos.<name>]`
  table for each repo, which say how far a save goes: `mode` (`off`, `commit`, `push`, `pr`
  or `pr-merge`), `branch`, `save_branch`, `sign`, `autosave` and `autosave_after`. The local
  file overrides the shared one key by key. Nothing saves by these settings yet. For now,
  `charter doctor` and the Project settings tab check them, and the doctor names
  `[memory] share` as the deprecated way of saying `mode`.
  ([#292](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/292))
- A vault can live in your system's own credential store: the Keychain on macOS, the Secret
  Service on Linux. `charter vault add <name>` makes one by default, and every `charter secret`
  and `charter vault` command works on it as on the other kinds. Each secret is its own
  Keychain item, and on macOS only the charter program that stored it can read it without the
  Keychain asking you first. A plaintext vault file is now something you ask for, with
  `--provider plain-file`. ([#233](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/233))
- **Vaults in the app.** A Vaults section in the Attention panel lists each vault with its
  provider and how many secrets it holds. Clicking one opens the vault in a tab of its own, as a
  persona opens, and the tab comes back at the next launch. The tab has a search box, **Add**,
  and a table of name, size and when each secret was written. Each row's menu has Edit value,
  Rename, Copy and Delete. The palette has *Open vault…* and *New vault…*, and a new vault is a
  keyring one unless you pick another kind. Nothing the window lists or writes ever carries a
  value back. ([#234](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/234),
  [#235](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/235))
- **Reveal and copy.** A secret's eye shows its value for 30 seconds, until you press it again,
  or until you press Escape. **Copy** puts the value on the clipboard without it reaching the
  window, marked for clipboard histories to skip. charter clears the clipboard a minute later, or
  when it quits, but only if the clipboard still holds that value. Each reveal and copy writes
  the trace event `charter secret get --reveal` writes, `secret-reveal`, with a `to` field saying
  `window` or `clipboard`. ([#236](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/236))
- **1Password tokens go into the Keychain, not your chats.** A 1Password vault's tab has a box
  to paste its service-account token straight into the system keyring; the token never enters
  charter's own environment. From then on every `charter secret` command reads it from the keyring,
  so the vault works in a chat and in a terminal that exports nothing. charter runs only the `op`
  it pinned when the token was stored, verified by path and code-signing team, so a chat cannot
  redirect the token to an `op` of its own; the keyring item is random per vault and machine, and
  the binding it was stored against is pinned locally, so a committed registry change cannot steer
  it. No chat the app starts is given any `OP_*` variable (case insensitively) or any other
  identity variable a vault declares. A tab can also move a token an app was launched with, and
  then warns to relaunch charter so the export leaves its process.
  ([#237](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/237))
- **Text size and Preferences.** The window's text and the terminal's each have a size, kept
  per machine, and a change applies at once. Cmd with `=`, `-` or `0` (Ctrl off macOS) makes
  whichever has focus larger, smaller or back to its default; `Ctrl+Shift+-` is left to the
  shell. The defaults are one step larger than before: 14px in the window, 13 in the terminal.
  The sizes live in a **Preferences** tab, which opens from the app menu (`Cmd+,`, or `Ctrl+,`
  off macOS), the palette, and the opener when no project is open.
  ([#283](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/283))
- An Ignore (✕) on each chat in the needs-you queue takes it out of the queue and out of the red
  counts on its project and workspace tabs at once, without touching the chat. It lasts until
  that chat asks again: its next stop puts it back as a new item. Delete on a focused item does
  the same (Backspace on a Mac), and the palette lists it as "Ignore … until it asks again".
  ([#248](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/248))
- A launch that has sessions to put back asks first: **Reopen all sessions**, or **Start
  fresh**, naming how many chats and view tabs each project had. Start fresh puts nothing back.
  Escape, closing the question, or no answer at all reopens them, as before.
  ([#250](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/250))
- When an update is installed, the title bar says **Restart to update**. It restarts charter
  into the new version and offers every chat and view tab back, with **Reopen all** as the
  answer in front and a line saying charter restarted to install an update. A chat that is
  mid-turn is named first, and you choose to restart now or wait. If the restart does not come
  back, the next launch offers the same sessions.
  ([#251](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/251))
- A chat is named for its persona and a number, such as `steward 1`, or for its harness, such as
  `claude 4`, when it has no persona. The picker has an optional Name field, and a chat's tab
  renames by a double-click, F2, its menu's Rename row or the palette. A blank name gives the
  default back. The name is charter's label only, so a rename never touches the running program,
  and it comes back with the chat after a relaunch.
  ([#254](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/254))
- A handed-off chat is named for its task. `charter handoff --name "<short task>"` names the new
  chat's tab, and the handoff skill always writes one from the brief; without it the tab is the
  ordinary `<persona> <N>`, so four handoffs from one chat are four tabs you can tell apart. The
  chat it came from is shown by name, never by number — `↳ from steward 3 · platform-next` in the
  tab's tooltip and the chat's corner, and in the new chat's first line.
  ([#258](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/258))
- A handoff can ask for an answer. With `charter handoff --report`, the new chat is told to
  finish with `charter handoff report "<summary>"`, and the chat that asked gets a needs-you item
  (`<chat> reported back`) and the report as context on its next turn — quoted as data, and never
  typed into it. The report goes only to the chat that asked, and exactly once per handoff —
  another needs another `--report` handoff; if that chat has closed, the next chat in its workspace learns it when
  it starts. Without `--report`, nothing changes. ([#259](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/259))
- Right-click a repo — its heading in the explorer, or its row in the bottom bar — for **New tab
  in** it, which starts that one tab's chat in the clone, and **Start new chats in** it, which
  makes the clone where every new chat starts until you pick somewhere else, as picking a
  worktree does one level down, and the explorer marks it.
  Shift+F10 or the menu key opens any of charter's menus on the row the keyboard is on.
  ([#174](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/174))
- The explorer is a tree to a screen reader and to the keyboard: Right opens a clone or moves to
  a row's first child, Left closes it or moves to its parent, and a typed letter moves to the
  next row starting with it. ([#238](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/238))
- Delete on a focused project or chat tab closes it, as its × does, and so does Backspace on a
  Mac. Ending a chat still asks first, and closing a project that has chats open now asks too,
  from the ×, Delete, the tab's menu and the palette, naming each chat it would end.
  ([#239](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/239))

### Changed

- The needs-you queue is in the title bar now, and nowhere else. A hand and a count sit left of
  About when anything needs you. When nothing has asked but a chat that can't report is open — a
  shell, or a harness without charter's hooks — it is a faint hand with no number, and its
  tooltip and list name those chats ("shell 2 can't tell charter it's waiting"). With neither,
  nothing is there. Pressing it lists every
  chat asking in every open project — its name, then its workspace and project — each with
  **Go**, which brings that chat to the front and switches project and workspace to get there,
  and **✕**, which ignores it. The Attention panel no longer has the queue; its other sections
  are unchanged. From the keyboard, Tab reaches the button, Enter opens the list, the arrows
  move, Delete ignores, and Escape closes it.
  ([#249](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/249))
- Tab reaches the whole window, in the order it is drawn. Each strip and each list is one stop,
  and the arrows, Home and End move inside it. A terminal keeps Tab for its shell, and
  Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab leave it. A pane's split and close controls show on hover and when
  the keyboard is on them, not all the time on the pane you are typing in.
  ([#189](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/189))
- Nothing in the window rubber-bands on macOS any more. A panel scrolls and the window does not,
  and a scroll no longer carries out of a panel into the page.
  ([#263](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/263))

### Fixed

- On Linux and Windows the app menu no longer takes a key the chat's shell owns: `Ctrl-C` in a
  chat is the interrupt again, not Copy, and the same goes for `Ctrl-A`, `Ctrl-Z`, `Ctrl-Y`,
  `Ctrl-V`, `Ctrl-X` and `Ctrl-H`. Quit is `Ctrl+Shift+Q` there, as in a terminal app. macOS is
  unchanged. ([#241](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/241))
- `charter doctor`'s `git auth` row checks the one-credential git policy, the check
  `charter git-policy` runs, instead of saying it is not checked. It only reads, and names
  `charter git-policy --apply` for a clone that drifted.
  ([#241](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/241))
- Closing a chat that was asking for you, with the × on its tab or by ending its pane, takes it
  out of the needs-you queue and out of the red counts on its project and workspace tabs. It
  used to stay there until some other chat moved.
  ([#247](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/247))
- A chat's report that raced a close, or an Ignore, can no longer put the chat back in the
  needs-you queue: every update the window gets is numbered, and it keeps the newest.
  ([#248](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/248))
- A persona's card names the vault `charter persona list` names. A persona whose definition has
  no `vault:` line but that `vaults.json` tags a vault to used to be shown as "not declared in
  its definition"; the card now shows that vault's name and says it came from the vault
  registry. A persona nothing names a vault for says so, a `vault: none` still says it holds no
  credentials of its own, and a registry that does not read is shown with charter's reason.
  ([#185](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/185))
- `charter persona stats` reads a dispatch log's timestamps as Python's
  `datetime.fromisoformat` did, digit for digit. A stamp such as `2026-03-04T100`, with three
  digits for the time, is skipped rather than read as ten o'clock, and so is a one-digit hour,
  minute or second. Any one character between the date and the time, a comma before the
  fraction and an offset with seconds all read as Python read them.
  ([#315](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/315))
- The panels follow the plane on disk. A todo closed with `charter ws todo done` in a terminal
  leaves the Todos panel and its count at once, and a workspace made in a terminal is watched
  from then on. Before, a panel changed only when you focused another workspace and came back.
  ([#264](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/264))
- `charter save` against a remote that moved no longer waits on a signer that never answers.
  The rebase that replays its commit has a two-minute deadline, as the commit itself does, and a
  rebase stopped at it is reported as out of time, not as a conflict. `charter save --sign`
  replays its commit signed, and a save without `--sign` never asks a signer.
  ([#242](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/242))

### Security

- The window can only invoke the commands on the app's allow-list. Every command it calls is
  now listed in one place and granted to the main window by name. Anything not on the list is
  refused before it runs, and so is a call from any other window. A vault's reveal and copy
  have a grant of their own and reach the main window only, so a window added later does not
  get them by default. The Content-Security-Policy is tighter as well: the window loads no
  plugins or frames, submits no forms, and accepts no `<base>`. The policy and the allow-list are
  now separate guards on reveal and copy. Before, the policy was the only one.
  ([#276](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/276))
- A `charter.local.toml` that git tracks, or would commit, no longer decides anything. The file
  is meant to stay on one machine, and charter already refused the harness profiles in it when
  git would carry it. The extensions, theme and harness plugins it chose were still applied,
  though, so a copy committed by mistake reached every clone of the plane. Now charter reads
  nothing in such a file, and the workspace and `charter.toml` decide instead. The Local section
  of Project settings still shows the file and says why it is not read and how to fix it: add
  `/charter.local.toml` to `.gitignore` (`charter reinit` does that), or, if git already tracks
  it, `git rm --cached` it first. ([#308](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/308))
  The Extensions, Theme and Harness plugins groups say it too, in the same words, in Project
  settings and in every Workspace settings tab, wherever the file set something. Before, a
  value you set in Local showed as decided by `charter.toml` or the workspace, with no reason
  given.
  ([#319](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/issues/319))

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-24

0.1.1 brings back what 0.1.0 left out and a working plane still used: vault access through
`charter secret` and `charter persona secret`, and the `persona use`, `list`, `sync-agents` and
`stats` commands. A chat started by charter 0.1.0 finds the app's own `charter` first on its
`PATH`, so a plane whose instructions call those commands lost them. This release restores them.

### Fixed

- `charter persona list`, `persona use`, `persona sync-agents` and `persona stats` work again,
  and answer as the charter your plane was set up with did. Re-syncing a plane's sub-agents
  changes only the ones whose persona changed since they were last generated.
  ([#228](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/228))
- `charter ws todo` says what it recorded, closed or dropped, and a slug that is not there
  says so instead of passing silently. ([#228](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/228))
- `charter secret`, `charter persona secret` and `charter vault` are back. A chat that runs
  `charter secret exec <vault> --file KUBECONFIG=<key> -- kubectl …` or `charter secret list
<vault>` got a usage error from 0.1.0, which put charter first on the chat's `PATH` without
  them; they now answer as the Python charter did, with the plain-file, reference and 1Password
  providers, and a value still never reaches the chat: `list` prints names, `get` a size band
  and a keyed fingerprint, and `exec` hands values to the command's environment or to 0600 temp
  files it removes, redacting what the command prints.
  ([#227](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/227))
- The Bash guard refuses a vault file read that is wrapped in `charter secret exec … --`, the
  way it refuses one wrapped in `env`. ([#227](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/227))
- The Bash guard no longer mistakes text for a handoff. A multi-line quoted string that
  mentions `charter handoff`, such as a commit message, is read as the text it is, and a real
  `charter handoff` after it is still judged. ([#226](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/226))
- A harness profile that wraps another program (`["ccs", "work"]`) starts as
  `ccs work --plugin-dir …`, with charter's flags after the profile's own words, so a wrapper
  that expects its subcommand first works. A plain `claude` or `codex` profile starts exactly as
  before. ([#226](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/226))
- What `charter docs show` serves, and every message charter prints, name only commands this
  charter has. A page about something it does not do is gone, and a planned command says "not in
  this version yet". ([#226](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/226))

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- charter is a desktop app for macOS and Linux. A window holds your projects as tabs, each
  project's workspaces, and each workspace's chats, and a chat is a live terminal running
  Claude Code or Codex.
  ([#14](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/14),
  [#111](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/111),
  [#125](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/125),
  [#131](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/131))
- Opening a project that you have not approved shows what it would run first, and nothing runs
  until you say yes. ([#110](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/110),
  [#121](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/121),
  [#145](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/145))
- A new chat starts on the harness profile and persona you pick, in the workspace or in one of
  its worktrees. ([#32](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/32),
  [#41](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/41))
- Every chat says what it is doing, and the chats waiting for you are listed first and counted
  in the window. ([#26](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/26),
  [#51](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/51),
  [#157](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/157))
- Chats open as tabs and split side by side. The split and close buttons sit on the pane they
  act on, and ending a chat asks first. ([#14](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/14),
  [#176](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/176))
- The window has four regions: a worktree explorer on the left, the chats in the centre, and a
  bottom bar with each repository's branch, changes, worktrees and running pipeline.
  ([#141](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/141),
  [#154](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/154),
  [#156](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/156))
- A worktree can be cut and removed from the window, and a workspace or a project can be made
  and deleted there too. ([#31](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/31),
  [#34](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/34),
  [#172](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/172),
  [#192](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/192))
- A command palette and right-click menus reach every action the bars have.
  ([#45](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/45),
  [#172](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/172),
  [#194](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/194))
- A project, a workspace and a chat can each be pinned.
  ([#143](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/143))
- A status line along the bottom of the window carries the doctor, the alerts drawer for every
  open project, and a note when a project pins an older charter.
  ([#153](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/153),
  [#160](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/160),
  [#162](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/162),
  [#165](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/165))
- Each chat shows its context and cache gauge in its pane's corner, with a bar per turn for its
  usage trend. ([#164](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/164),
  [#167](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/167))
- The personas panel lists each persona with its memories, searchable and loaded a page at a
  time. ([#173](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/173),
  [#206](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/206))
- An extension is a directory you point charter at. Nothing it declares is in force until you
  approve it, and charter asks again when anything in that directory changes.
  ([#150](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/150),
  [#180](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/180))
- A request that belongs in another chat can be handed off from inside the app.
  ([#207](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/207))
- The title bar says which project, workspace and chat you are in, and opens About Charter.
  ([#205](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/205))
- The app updates itself from a stable or a dev channel, and installs only what the release
  key signed. ([#158](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/158))
- The `charter` command ships inside the app, so hooks and the Bash guard answer without a
  Python install. ([#168](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/168),
  [#181](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/181))
- A tab can hold a view, not only a chat. A persona opens as its own tab: what it is for, its
  tools and vault, and its memories, searchable. An approved extension can add a view of its
  own. The first is persona statistics, with charts of each persona's memories, which charter
  asks one question at a time and only when you open it. ([#212](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/212))
- The view tabs you had open come back at the next launch, and wait for a click before an
  extension is asked anything.
  ([#212](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/212))
- The palette can put the app's own `charter` on your terminal's `PATH` on macOS: **Install
  `charter` command in PATH** links `/usr/local/bin/charter` to it, and never replaces a
  `charter` something else put there. ([#219](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/219))
- A chat opens knowing who it is: the persona you picked, what it remembers, and the
  workspace's todos arrive with its first message. The guards on reading a vault, on writing
  into charter's own state, and on sending a sub-agent run in the app's own `charter`.
  ([#220](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/220))

### Changed

- A chat needs nothing installed from the Python charter. The app carries its own Claude Code
  plugin with charter's hooks, its Bash guard and its skills, and loads it into each chat it
  starts, for that chat alone. The chat turns the Python charter's plugin off for itself, and
  finds the app's own `charter` first on its `PATH`. A chat starts offline.
  ([#219](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/219))
- The light and dark themes are data files, and the window and the terminal are both drawn from
  them. ([#144](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/144))
- The terminal follows a theme switch while it is open. The window's layout lives in
  `charter/layout.json`, which you can edit by hand, and it is in place before the first
  frame is drawn. ([#215](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/215))
- About Charter tells this app's own story: its version and what that version brought.
  ([#215](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/215))
- The region toggles sit at the left end of the status line. The context gauge floats over its
  pane rather than taking a row from it, and a very light line divides one tab from the next.
  ([#214](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/214))
- The project, workspace and chat strips nest, and tabs that do not fit collapse into a
  _N more_ button instead of scrolling. ([#139](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/139),
  [#171](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/171))
- Closing the window hides it to the tray. Quitting says which chats it will end, and the next
  launch puts back the projects and chats you had open.
  ([#23](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/23),
  [#125](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/125))
- Tab moves through every dialog, and Ctrl-K belongs to the chat that has the keyboard.
  ([#188](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/188),
  [#190](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/190))
- `charter init` adopts the repository it is pointed at instead of turning it into a plane.
  ([#115](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/115),
  [#197](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/197))
- The app, the dock and the menu bar carry charter's own mark.
  ([#159](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/159),
  [#203](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/203))
- A macOS build is ad-hoc signed when no Apple Developer ID is set up. The first install needs
  one command, and the release page says which.
  ([#201](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/201))
- `charter version` prints the app's own version. A plane pinned to a release
  of the Python charter is reported as that older line, not as drift. `charter doctor` and
  every other message stop sending you to the Python charter, and `charter docs show`
  describes this app. ([#219](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/219),
  [#223](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/223))

### Fixed

- A program that starts a screen update and never finishes it no longer freezes the pane.
  ([#7](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/7),
  [#19](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/19))
- A pane opened late catches up on what the chat already printed.
  ([#11](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/11))
- A chat started from an app opened in Finder finds `charter` and its harness.
  ([#135](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/135),
  [#168](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/168))
- An extension's program that crashes is reported with its exit status and its last words,
  not as a lost connection. ([#217](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/217))
- A slow `git` is no longer reported as a broken repository.
  ([#44](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-app/pull/44))
- No program charter starts can hold a chat's terminal open after the chat ends.
