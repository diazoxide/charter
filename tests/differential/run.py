"""Differential tests: the same command, run by both implementations, must leave the same plane.

Spec decision 14 (as amended): every module that moves to Rust passes a differential test —
the same fixture plane and the same input give the same output and the same resulting plane in
both implementations. This is that test for the plane writes.

Each scenario copies a fixture plane TWICE. Python charter runs one command against the first
copy; the Rust `charter` binary runs the same command against the second. Then the two trees are
compared file by file, byte for byte, and so is stdout.

    ./run.py                        # every scenario
    ./run.py --scenario vision      # one
    ./run.py --binary path/to/charter

The Rust binary defaults to `target/debug/charter`; build it first (`cargo build -p charter-cli`).

Python is a DEV DEPENDENCY OF THIS TEST and of nothing else — never of the app, the binary or an
installer (spec decision 15). It is pinned to the same charter commit that generated the fixture
planes, so a fixture and the oracle that checks against it can never drift apart.

Determinism: the clock, the hostname, the user and the timezone are pinned for the Python side
exactly as `tests/fixtures/planes/generate.py` pins them, and the Rust side is given the same
instant through `--now`. Without that, a memory's filename — which carries `%Y%m%d-%H%M%S` of the
LOCAL clock — would differ by the second the two processes happened to run in.
