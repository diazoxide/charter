and not in a public issue.

## What charter's chat sandbox is, and what it is not

A plane can put every chat charter starts in a sandbox ([ADR 0067](docs/adr/0067-a-chat-runs-in-a-sandbox-charter-compiles-for-its-harness.md)):
`[sandbox]` with `mode = "on"` in its `charter.toml` ([the plane format](docs/plane-format.md)).

**What it covers.** Chats that charter starts, on a harness charter compiles the policy for.
Today that is Claude Code. A sandboxed chat reaches only the hosts of the plane's egress
presets. It is always denied four classes: a vault's storage, charter's integrity state, the
powers that belong to a person, and, on a runner, the runner's own internals. A chat that
cannot be given all of this does not start. A plane can turn the sandbox on, but never off.

**What it does not cover.**

- **Agents charter did not start.** For those, charter can export each harness's managed
  settings. It does not enforce them.
- **Charter itself.** Charter reads and writes files in a chat's directory by name. Until the
  `openat` rewrite of charter's core and its external review land
  ([ADR 0028](docs/adr/0028-containment-checks-a-path-and-does-not-hold-it.md)), a sandboxed
  chat that races charter's own file access may get charter to do what the chat cannot. So the
  sandbox is a boundary between a chat and the machine, not between a chat and charter.
- **Codex and opencode chats.** Charter does not sandbox them yet, so a plane with the sandbox
  on does not start them.
- **The `PreToolUse` guard.** It is a guard against mistakes, not against an attacker with
  shell access as your user. The sandbox is what enforces. The guard explains a refusal.
